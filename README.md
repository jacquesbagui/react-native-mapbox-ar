# Mapbox Augmented Reality SDK for React Native

_An official React Native component for building cross platform augmented reality applications_

**Note this SDK is in it's beta phase and will be under heavy development as we move towards our 1.0**

## What is Mapbox?

Mapbox is the location data platform for mobile and web applications. We provide [building blocks](https://www.mapbox.com/products/) to add location features like maps, search, and navigation into any experience you create. Use our simple and powerful APIs & SDKs and our open source libraries for interactivity and control.

## Sign up for Mapbox

Not a Mapbox user yet? [Sign up for an account here](https://www.mapbox.com/signup/). Once youâ€™re signed in, all you need to start building is a Mapbox access token. Use this same short code with all of our interactive mapping libraries, Python and JavaScript SDKs, and directly against our REST APIs. You can create and manage your access tokens on your [Mapbox Account page](https://www.mapbox.com/account/).


## Getting Started

We provide geospatial components that will work [react-viro](https://viromedia.com/viroreact/). We suggest that when
setting up a project that you follow Viro's [quick start](https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/viro-platform-overview).

More detailed instructions are on the way! Checkout our [example project in the meantime](/RNMapboxARDemo/README.md)
